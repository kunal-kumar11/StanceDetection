one of the best memory cards for a good low price sandisk has and will always be a great company to do business with
i got the ultra becuase it said it lets your camera phone save pictures faster it seems to do that also it was a great price
i didnt really need this for my phone but i figured i may as well get it got to love gb of storage works good for when recording p video
i purchased two of these microsdxc cards when they were on sale around black friday and have been using them now for just about two months they work wonderfully and i have had absolutely no problems with either these sandisk memory cards are  gb microsdxc class  uhs cards which are rated for transfer speeds up to mbsecthe uhs class  designation is intended as an performance measure that indicates the card is capable of supporting realtime full hd video recording of course this only works if you are using a device which is capable of writing to the card at those speeds but most modern devices that offer full hd recording such as camcorders digital slr cameras and cell phones with built in full hd recording do support this standard the benefit of using a uhs card on a uhs certified device is that you should not encounter the problem of buffering or your device stopping recording because it could not write fast enoughhowever because these are extra high capacity sdxc cards you will need to make sure that your device can support microsdxc cards and not simply microsd or microsdhc ones the biggest difference is that the microsdxc standard uses the exfat file system rather than the fat or ntfs systems while most modern android devices and in fact most linuxunix devices can handle that without difficulty some devices such as older cameras android devices and some windows devices may have difficulty with the formathaving said that ive been using these in nikon d  d digital slr cameras as well as samsung galaxy s and galaxy s relay g phones without any difficulty and they read  write fine on my computers all in all these were a great buy and im very happy with them
if you have a gopro get a different card it worked in mine for a while then stopped turns out the gopro fried it no fault of gopro but through sandisks error sandisk will replace it but it can get fried again ive read up on it and its a common issue so if you use this for a gopro get a samsung or patriot or something else to be on the safe side
i purchased this memory card for use in a galaxy s smart phone  music stored on the card plays without problems  works great and while not the cheapest the price was not badupdate after about  month of use the card failed  after a few emails to sandisk they issued and rma and promptly provided a warranty replacement  on the whole great service  these things are tiny and some failures are expected so as long as this one keeps working i still give it  stars
i wait for flash media sales to purchase sd card various sizes  i got the gb size for my gopro  and it works great  i see no issues with the speed  the pricegb was great on these  best of all this has been completely reliable for me  no complaints whatsoever
big fan of sandisk and even more so as the price of flash decreases cant compare to other brands as never has a reason to switch minor price variations do not compel to do so and performancequality has never been in issue in many years of suing brand
bought this and have tested in my canon sx videos record quick and replay without any lossplaced in my samsung galaxy tab and works greatnothing bad to report about this sdhc module
loaded up my mp collection in no time for use in my phone came with sd adapter and in very small packaging almost nothing to throw away card has worked great in my phone so far no lag on video or audio good deal  usd
